/* Apple Gradient Research Notes */

1. Apple Intelligence Gradient Styles:
   - Main heading gradient: Blue (#4285F4) to Purple (#A259FF) to Pink (#FF5757) to Orange (#FF914D)
   - Text gradients use similar color schemes but with varying intensity
   - Subtle background gradients with low opacity overlays
   - Gradient directions vary (diagonal, horizontal, radial) depending on element purpose

2. Mobile Design Patterns:
   - Clean, minimal interface with plenty of whitespace
   - Large, readable typography that scales well on mobile
   - Full-width containers on mobile with appropriate padding
   - Touch-friendly UI elements (min 44px height/width for interactive elements)
   - Smooth transitions and animations optimized for mobile performance
   - Consistent navigation that collapses appropriately on smaller screens
   - Proper spacing between interactive elements to prevent accidental taps

3. Implementation Ideas:
   - Add Apple-style gradients to:
     * Main heading text
     * Section headings
     * Hero section background
     * Call-to-action buttons
     * Dark mode toggle
     * Work cards hover effects
   
   - Mobile Improvements:
     * Fix navigation menu on smaller screens
     * Ensure proper touch target sizes
     * Optimize spacing between elements
     * Improve form field usability on mobile
     * Ensure parallax effects don't cause performance issues on mobile
     * Test and fix any layout issues in the skills carousel
